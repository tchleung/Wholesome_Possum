## **Background**
Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the fifth installment of the Animal Crossing Series. After years of development, it was released on March 20th, 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic.
<br/><br/>
It could not have come at a better timing: shelter-in-place means ample free time, and there was a lack of new game releases from other major competitors. It sold over 11M copies in six weeks according to Nintendo's recent [financial release](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/200507e.pdf), and it is projected to be the best-selling installment in the franchise history.
<br/><br/>
So what is Animal Crossing? It is a social-simulation game. There is no shooting or fighting monsters (unless you count tarantula and wasps). Instead, you are fishing, catching insects, and developing a deserted island into your own tropical paradise. It is the embodiment of escapisim when the world around us is crumbling down.

## **Motivation**
Due to the nature of the game, the Animal Crossing community is often described as being "wholesome". In contrast, other video games with competitive elements are often associated with a "toxic" online environment, where the dominant topics are complaints or heated debates.
<br/><br/>
As a data scientist who frequents various Animal Crossing online communities (Twitter, Reddit, etc), I wanted to check on my rose-colored glasses. Hence, I set out to find some answers:
1. How wholesome is the Animal Crossing community? 
2. What are some hot topics?

## **Data**
I decided to focus on the Animal Crossing subreddit. It has over a million subscribers and a high volume of traffic, so there is plenty of data.
<br/>
Unfortunately, Reddit removed the functionality to query by timestamp from their API some years ago. Fortunately, I found [pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/) which provides exactly what I wanted
